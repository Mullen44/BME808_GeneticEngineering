1: CPG Islands - This Code loops through a DNA strand incrementing by the size of a specific window and searches for areas with high C and G content.  These locations are more stable due to 3 hydrogen bonds between base pairs (vs 2 between A and T) and therefore are often found at the start of a coding sequence.

2: Gene Pattern Finder - Coding strands of DNA have different features which are necessary for the strand to be
